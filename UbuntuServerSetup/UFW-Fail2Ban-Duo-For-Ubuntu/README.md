This playbook is designed specifically for Debian based systems. It installs and configures UFW & fail2ban. This playbook installs fail2ban and copies a JailConf file to /etc/fail2ban/jail.local on the remote server. Update the JailConf file for your specific use cases! The only included jail (as of currently) is [sshd]. it isnstalls UFW and configures default rules to allow outgoing and deny incoming requests and is set to allow a custom port (ssh etc.) Add allowed ports as needed!
